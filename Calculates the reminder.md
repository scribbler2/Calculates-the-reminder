num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

remainder = num1 % num2

print("The remainder when", num1, "is divided by", num2, "is", remainder)
```

    Enter the first number: 10
    Enter the second number: 2
    The remainder when 10.0 is divided by 2.0 is 0.0
